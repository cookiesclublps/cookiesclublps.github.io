	<h3>About the Cookies Club: principles & team</h3>
	<p>The club meets once a month, on a Wednesday at 5pm.</p> 
	<p>At each session, two people are expected to give a talk, on a voluntary basis. Their presentation should last about 15-20 minutes and is followed by a few minutes of questions. Presenters have a lot of freedom to choose the subject of their talk: of course this can be a specific aspect of their PhD/Post-Doc work, but it can also be related to their doctoral mission or about an article they have found interesting. It just has to be about Physics and be understandable by everyone (indeed, the language of the club is English). Try to be as didactic as possible: we strongly recommend spending the first few minutes of the presentation making a general introduction that will put everyone on the same level before presenting results and their interpretations. A good way to organize the presentation is to formulate a problem and answer it.</p> 
	<p>For the club to be successful in a durable way, every member should ideally speak twice during the duration of their PhD/Post-Doc. So don't hesitate to register, it will be a good training for your next oral interventions in front of assemblies much more intimidating than a few hungry students.</p>
	<p>The club is currently managed by Manon Marchand (2nd year PhD student, team MMOI), Chaima Essghaier (3rd year PhD student, team HP) and Eloi Haltz (3rd year PhD student, team IDMAG).</p>
